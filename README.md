### Hey, I'm Digital! 👋

I'm a 15 year old Web Developer & Java Developer.

### Current Projects 📓

I'm currently working on [MCMagic](https://mcmagic.us) - it's a minecraft theme park server that plans on giving a refreshing experience with a most accurate replica of the Walt Disney World parks. 

## Experience 📫

I'm currently learning Java, JavaScript, and Kotlin. Currently I have the most experience with Web Development (CSS, HTML) for a period of 6 months now (still getting learning about it more!). Have any inquiries? Feel free to contact me through discord below!
